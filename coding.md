| gap in commit activity for external reasons                                    | Generally the space between commits is not related to the code, but something else. i.e. Discussion, waiting on feedback, commiters schedule and outside responsibilities, etc.                                                                           |
| gap in commit activity for external reasons                                    | Happens more often due to delays Clausen by vacation, business duties,....                                                                                                                                                                                |
| gap in commit activity for external reasons                                    | I think that a couple of days between commits is not a big deal, could be travelling, illness, any number of things.  If someone who committed daily vanished for six months and then re-appeared that would be more interesting.                         |
| gap in commit activity for external reasons                                    | This particular project is updated less frequently than some of our other projects, so its not really uncommon to have such a long span of time between contributions.                                                                                    |
| gap in commit activity for external reasons                                    | The only problem with this kind of metric at medium lengths of time like a few weeks is that open source projects are side-time for most of us.                                                                                                           |
